# ROSK
### Let's hope that won't be discovered and banned
This is the popular game of R__K. Is a complex game since there is all the model, controller, server and cli functionality.
Till now it took 30 hour more or less and I developed all the model and the controller easily, done all the tests, then started the server, the client and all the other things that are needed.
The most tidius thing is that when you reach the net part you have to build a lot of things all together, beacuse you need at least a cli and a server, but then to see all the messages you need a printer class,
to interact you need a parser of your user input, to see changes in the model you need a lightview that cooperates with the printer. So there is a lot of concurrent work
